<b>✨ Didac's Digital Twinbot ✨</b>

Welcome 👋 to the Twinbot! This AI-powered assistant 🤖 is a proof of concept 🚀, created using Ollama 🦙 and trained on data inspired by my real-life experiences 🌟.

To ensure safety and privacy 🔒, the dataset has been carefully curated 🧐 to avoid sharing sensitive personal information 🤫.

You can interact with the Twinbot 💬 by asking any question ❓ you'd like to know about me 🤔.

<i>Please note 📌 that as a chat-based language model, the Twinbot might occasionally produce inaccurate responses or hallucinations 🤯. While it strives for accuracy, it remains an experimental 🧪 system.</i>

<i>As the model runs on compact, energy-efficient 🔋 hardware — specifically a Raspberry Pi 5 💻 without a GPU 🧠 — running times may be slightly longer 🐢. But hey, good things are worth the wait ⏳.</i>

Thank you 🙏 for playing along 🎲, and enjoy the experience! 😉
